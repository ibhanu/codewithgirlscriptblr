# Code with GirlScript Bangalore

## About the program

Thanks for your interest in **CodeWithGirlscript**. 

The aim of this program is to help the participants explore the Open Source world and take their first step towards contributing to it.

If you are starting your journey in Free and Open Source Software Development, then this is the right place. This program is also ideal to coding professionals who would like to challenge their problem solving skills.

We have a wide range of problems from easy, medium, and hard levels for you to solve. The problem statements are independent of any technology stacks, so you can focus on the underlying concepts. 

Follow the guidelines mentioned in Contribution.MD file, and "Let's Code for Freedom".


## Table of Contents

- [Beginner Level Problems](Easy/README.md)
- [Intermediate Level Problems](Medium/README.md)
- [Advanced Level Problems](Hard/README.md)


## Guidelines

- A time limit will be mentioned along with each problem statement. Eligibility of rewards is subject to strict adherence to the mentioned deadlines.
- You are free to attempt any question beyond the deadline as well. However, the submission will not be accepted as part of the CodeWithGirlscript program.
- One of the most important things in the FOSS world are your [commits](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages). Do not assume that anything is implicit.
- Raise a pull request only when you are satisfied with the solution.
- For each problem statement, an abstract form of the question has been provided in the readme files of the corresponding levels. 
- A screenshot showing the solution must also be pushed along with the final submission.
- Contributors who are able to complete all levels of a problem statement will have a chance to join our team of **Reviewers**.
- The problems have been segregated in a way that you can choose the level of complexity you would like to begin with. You can directly solve the Advanced level of a problem statement, or progress towards it by attempting Beginner or Intermediate levels.
- It goes without saying that plagiarism is strictly discouraged. Kindly refrain from the urge to do it, just because it may go unnoticed. If caught, your profile will be flagged and you will not be elgible to participate in any GirlScript events globally.
